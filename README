YayPonies iTunes Nagios check scripts
-------------------------------------
YP tools are provided as it is, there might or might not
be a README, we warranty absolutely nothing, it does work for us.
-------------------------------------

usage:

- check_itunes : check the number of episode released, will report a critical problem to nagios if the number
given in argument doesn't match with the one on iTunes
	
	Example:
	./check_itunes 9001
	Expected was 9001 EP, found 2 EP
	./check_itunes 2   
	No new ponies :/

- check_comics : check the result of an iTunes search, first argument is the comic serie (FiM for main serie, FF for Friends Forever, A for Annual), second argument should be the comic number.

	Example:
	./check_comics FiM 34
	SUCCESS: My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic #34 - Avaialble for Purchase! :)
	./check_comics FiM 35
	ERROR: My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic #35 - Not Found! :/
	./check_comics A 2015
	ERROR: My Little Pony Annual 2015 - Not Found! :/
	./check_comics A 2014
	SUCCESS: My Little Pony Annual 2014 - Avaialble for Purchase! :)

- check_led : It was never used for pony, but I needed to check the color of a led, if it wasn't red, I needed nagios to
warn me, this script download an image (in my case, it was on a IP camera built with an old android phone), take 1 pixel and analyse it to see if it's red or not.
